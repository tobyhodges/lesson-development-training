## One Up, One Down (10 min)

Provide one up, one down feedback on the entire Collaborative Lesson Development Training. 
Remember:

- Say only one thing, and try not to duplicate.
  This gets harder for those who come later!
- Trainers should try not to respond, only record responses (e.g. in the Etherpad). 
  This is also hard, but important!

# Reflection exercise (15 min)

Take this time to reflect on what you have learned in this last part of the training,
and take some action to plan to successfully complete the development of your lesson
after you leave.
It is up to you how you use this time, but you might find some inspiration in the prompts below.

- How could you use the project management features of GitHub to 
  prepare for the next stage of the lesson development process?
- If you have been working in a collaborative group,
  what steps could your group take to improve the way you work together
  for the remainder of the project?
- If you have been working on the lesson alone so far,
  what steps could you take to find new collaborators to help you 
  with the further development of your lesson?
- Based on the experience of teaching a section of your lesson,
  do the objectives you wrote for your lesson still seem realistic?
  Can you identify anything that can be added or removed 
  now that you have completed a trial run?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Documenting your lesson project, curating your lesson repository, welcoming new contributions, and taking advantage of GitHub's project management features all make it easier for people to collaborate with you.
- Any lesson can be improved with feedback, including this one.
