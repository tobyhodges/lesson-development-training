<p>The main objective of this training is to teach you the skills you need to design and develop an effective lesson, in collaboration with other members of the community. During the training, we will introduce the steps you can take to design and develop a lesson to meet the needs of your target audience, and give you time to begin implementing those steps during the workshop itself.</p>
<p>We will focus on three main areas:</p>
<div class="section level3">

<section id="a-lesson-design-process"><h2 class="section-heading">A Lesson Design Process</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In order to design an effective lesson, we need a structured approach with the learner in mind and clearly identified goals. Throughout this training, we will use a modified version of <a href="https://f1000research.com/documents/9-1377" class="external-link">Nichollâs five phase paradigm for curriculum design</a>. Nichollâs paradigm describes a process, commonly referred to as <em>backward design</em>, where those who wish to develop a new curriculum first begin by defining exactly what their learners will be able to do <em>after they have completed the lesson/training/course</em>. The subsequent stages of the curriculum design process involve designing content to directly meet those stated outcomes.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Select learning outcomes</li>
<li>Choose learning experiences to help learners achieve these outcomes</li>
<li>Develop content to support these experiences</li>
<li>Assess learner progress towards desired outcomes</li>
<li>Evaluate chosen outcomes, experiences, and content based on this assessment</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>TODO: add a figure illustrating the setps in the list above. could be based on Fig. 2 in <a href="https://f1000research.com/documents/9-1377" class="external-link">f1000-course-design-guide</a></strong></p>
<p>The last two phases of Nichollâs paradigm involve assessing learner progress towards the desired learning outcomes and evaluating the stated objectives and current content in light of the results of that assessment. In The Carpentries, most workshops are relatively short-format, without room for an extensive assessment after the teaching has finished (a <em>summative</em> assessment). To account for this, our lessons place an emphasis on <em>formative</em> assessment: assessment of learner progress that takes place <em>while the teaching is still going on</em>, to give instructors opportunities to evaluate the teaching and lesson content before the end of the workshop.</p>
<p>To account for this, we have adapted Nichollâs five phases in this training, to place an emphasis on assessing learning during a workshop:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Define desired learning outcomes</li>
<li>Decide with what activities/examples/explanations we will try to teach these skills</li>
<li>Create assessments to determine progress towards desired outcomes</li>
<li>Write content to lead learners from one of these assessments to the next</li>
<li>(After the break) evaluate how closely the outcomes meet the objectives</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>TODO: add a figure illustrating the process described in the list above. could be similar to the one used earlier for Nichollâs original list.</strong></p>

<section id="target-audience"><h2 class="section-heading">Target Audience</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Given the limited time in a short-format training, it is vital to define the scope of the lesson i.e. what people will know before and after the lesson. Thinking carefully about the target audience will help you with this and defining desired learning outcomes (the first step of the lesson design). Prominently displaying a description of the target audience will also help attract people with the right motivation and relevant prior knowledge to attend your workshops.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="expertise">Expertise<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#expertise"></a>
</h3>
<p>One of the most important things we can identify about our target audience is the level of expertise they will already have in relation to the skills taught by your lesson. In The Carpentries Instructor Training curriculum, we describe <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning/index.html#the-acquisition-of-skill" class="external-link">three different stages of skill acquisition: novice, competent practitioner, and expert</a> and how it directly correlates to the complexity of <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning/index.html#building-a-mental-model" class="external-link">mental models</a> these different groups have about a domain/topic.</p>
<p>Briefly, the novice is someone who does not know what they do not know, i.e., they do not yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or how they relate, the competent practitioner has enough understanding of the domain/topic for everyday purposes, and the expert is someone who can easily handle situations that are out of the ordinary and can immediately use their prior knowledge or skills when presented with a new problem in the domain.</p>
<p>When designing a new lesson, it is important to think about the level of expertise that you expect learners to arrive with for two reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It helps to predict what prior knowledge and <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning/index.html#building-a-mental-model" class="external-link">mental model</a> learners will have of the lesson domain when they arrive. This can enable you to make progress quickly by
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>working to help learners recall (<em>activate</em>) that prior knowledge,</li>
<li>building on the conceptual understanding they already have and,</li>
<li>perhaps most importantly, giving you some idea of what <em>misconceptions</em> they might arrive with. It is vital that misconceptions are identified and corrected early on, before learners try to incorporate new knowledge into a broken mental model.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>People at different stages of this process need to be taught differently. For example, novices will learn more from lessons that include worked examples and are more tutorial-like i.e.Â focused on a specific task, with step-by-step explanations of the process, but without a lot of extra information that is not directly relevant. However, the same approach may actually hinder learning for competent practitioners <a href="https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/blob/gh-pages/files/papers/kirschner-minimal-guidance-fails-2006.pdf" class="external-link">who may be distracted by a step-by-step explanation of something they already have the prior knowledge of</a>. For learners at this level of expertise, lessons which include activities offering learners the freedom to explore options and develop their own solutions, are likely to be more effective.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#motivation"></a>
</h3>
<p>Furthermore, your lesson will be more effective if it aligns with the motivations of the target audience. Understanding the wants and needs of your target audience, what they know already and what kinds of problems they want to solve, will help you design a lesson that learners can see the value in. It will give them the impression that taking the lesson will be worthwhile (called <em>positive expectancies</em> in the literature).</p>
<p>We will look more at strategies to establish value and build positive expectancies in the next episode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="be-specific">Be Specific<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#be-specific"></a>
</h3>
<p>It can be tempting to identify a target audience only in vague terms, for example by writing that a lesson is aimed at âPhD studentsâ or âearly career researchersâ. However, taking the time to focus on real people, or imagined personae, who represent your target audience will help you take time to consider the various aspects that can influence how much someone will learn from your lesson. It will also help you notice when the assumptions you are making about your target audience are unreasonable.</p>
<p>Most of all, it will help you stay connected to the fact that <em>you are not your learners</em>: they will arrive at the lesson with different priorities, interests, and challenges than your own.</p>

<p>There is more to consider about your target audience than we could capture with only the questions listed above. In your own time, you should think more about the other considerations you might need to make when writing a lesson for your audience.</p>
<p>For example, what vocabulary do they use? The terms you are teaching in your lesson might have a different meaning in your learnersâ domain of expertise, and it can be helpful to prepare for and try to avoid confusion arising from this clash. Furthermore, might their primary language differ from yours? If so, how might this change the way you write the lesson?</p>

</section><section id="defining-prerequisite-knowledge"><h2 class="section-heading">Defining Prerequisite Knowledge</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>A very common challenge encountered in workshops is heterogeneity of expertise among the audience. When learners arrive at a workshop with a wide range of previous experience with the topic, it is difficult for the instructors to keep everyone engaged. Those who arrive with too little relevant knowledge and experience can struggle to follow the lesson content at the pace you expect, while those who arrive with too much are likely to become bored and despondent as their expectation of learning new skills is not met.</p>
<p>One way to try to guard against this is to publish the description of your target audience when you advertise a workshop teaching your lesson, alongside a list summarising the skills and conceptual knowledge you expect learners to arrive with. Another is to use the information you have about your target audience to ask questions of potential learners when they apply/register to join the workshop (like the diagnostic questionnaire you may have prepared in the exercise above), and use the answers they give to filter out those who fall outside your intended audience.</p>
<p>While valuable, this kind of pre-assessment should be approached with caution: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.92.1.160" class="external-link">people are often bad at self-assessment i.e.Â estimating our own ability to perform a task</a>. We can try to mitigate for this when designing the questions for a pre-workshop survey, leaving little room for inaccurate self-assessment to confound the results. But experience suggests it is very difficult to ensure that every learner in a workshop falls within the intended audience of a lesson.</p>

<p>At this stage of the training, you should have a clear idea of who the target audience is for your lesson, and what knowledge, skills, and abilities you expect them to arrive with. Now it is time to consider the additional knowledge, skills, and abilities they will have by the time they leave: these are the <em>learning outcomes</em> of your lesson. It can feel strange to jump from one end of the process to the other like this, but clearly defining your goals early in the lesson development process is vital. As we will see in this episode, it helps you to determine the activities, examples, etc. that are appropriate for the lesson content, and provides a scope for what should and should not be included.</p>
<section id="why-focus-on-skills"><h2 class="section-heading">Why focus on skills?</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>To ensure your audience stays motivated, and your lesson feels relevant to them, we recommend that lessons focus on teaching skills rather than tools. Lessons should be centred around what you are empowering learners to <em>do</em>, what will be most beneficial to them, rather than a list of functions or commands you are teaching them to use. Placing the emphasis on skills over tools will help you prioritise key concepts and consider how your lesson can have the biggest impact on the way learners do their work.</p>
</section><section id="learning-objectives"><h2 class="section-heading">Learning objectives</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The desired outcomes (the <em>learning objectives</em>) of a lesson should be new skills, i.e.Â things that the learner can do. For the vast majority of lessons, these will be <em>cognitive skills</em>: things learners can do with their minds. (Lessons intended to teach other kinds of skill, such as woodwork, playing a musical instrument, or making sushi, are probably better suited to a different platform than a static website.) Cognitive skills cannot be equally easily acquired: before we can apply concepts and create something new, we must attain the ability to remember and distinguish between new concepts. Remembering and distinguishing are also abilities that are often faster to gain then applying or creating.</p>
<p>We must try to be realistic about how far along this scale we can move learners during a single workshop/lesson. This is one reason why the target audience is so important: if we can predict what learners will know when they arrive at the lesson, we can better define the outcomes we can expect when they leave.</p>
<p>Defining objectives for a lesson is essential because it allows us to focus the rest of our time on developing content that is necessary for learners to reach these goals. It will help us ensure we do not miss anything important or, conversely, include anything superfluous that could use up valuable time or distract instructors and learners.</p>
</section><section id="what-does-an-objective-look-like"><h2 class="section-heading">What does an objective look like?</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Objectives can be defined for a lesson as a whole - what should learners be able to do at the end of a workshop teaching this lesson? - and for individual sections within it - what should learners be able to do after following this particular part of the lesson? The objectives for the current section of this training are:</p>
<div id="checklist1" class="callout checklist">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="check-square"></i>
</div>
<div id="objectives-for-this-section" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Objectives for this section</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<ul>
<li>Explain the importance of defining specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound objectives for a lesson.</li>
<li>Evaluate a written lesson objective according to these criteria.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>These should be read as if they were endings to a sentence beginning</p>
<blockquote>
<p>âAt the end of this session, learners should be able to â¦â</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each objective starts with a verb and describes one (and only one) skill the learner will obtain.</p>
<p>For objectives to be as helpful as possible, they need to be written in a way that will allow us to directly observe whether or not a learner has attained the skills we want them to. This means that the skills described by our objectives should be measurable: as a general rule, action verbs such as âexplain,â âchoose,â or âpredict,â are more helpful than passive verbs such as âknow,â âunderstand,â or âappreciateâ, which are hard to directly assess and are often open to interpretation.</p>
<p>A popular aid for defining learning objectives is <a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/" class="external-link">Bloomâs Taxonomy</a>, which divides cognitive skills into several categories. The original taxonomy arranged these categories in a strict hierarchy, which has since been disputed. Regardless of whether these skills conform to such a hierarchy, Bloomâs Taxonomy serves as a very useful bank of action verbs for use in learning objectives.</p>
<p>We will see how helpful it can be to use action verbs in learning objectives when we begin talking about exercise design in the coming episodes.</p>
</section><section id="smart-objectives"><h2 class="section-heading">SMART objectives</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>To assist you in defining and writing learning objectives for your lesson, it can be helpful to turn to a popular framework for defining goals: <em>SMART</em>.</p>
<p>SMART objectives should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>S</strong>pecific: they should clearly describe a particular skill or ability the learner should have.</li>
<li>
<strong>M</strong>easurable: it should be possible to observe and ascertain when the learner has learned the skill/abilities described in the objectives.</li>
<li>
<strong>A</strong>ttainable: the learner should realistically be able to acquire the skills or abilities in the time available in a workshop/by following the text of the lesson.</li>
<li>
<strong>R</strong>elevant: they should be relevant to the overall topic or domain of the lesson as a whole.</li>
<li>
<strong>T</strong>ime-bound: they should include some timeframe within which the goal will be reached. For learning objectives, this is built into the approach described above.</li>

<p>Objective 1 is the closest to what we ideally want in a lesson objective, but it illustrates how difficult it can be to make an objective truly specific. For example, a more specific and measurable version of this objective could be:</p>

</section><section id="lesson-scope"><h2 class="section-heading">Lesson scope</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>One of the major challenges of lesson design is choosing what to include in a lesson: what the main points will be, in what order they will be introduced, how much detail can be provided, and how much time can be spent on each point. Especially when writing lessons for short form training like a Carpentries workshop, difficult decisions often need to be made about what can and cannot be included. <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/advan.00061.2005" class="external-link">Trying to fit too much content into a lesson is counter-productive</a>, so it is good to avoid the temptation to cram in more content than you have time to cover properly.</p>
<p>Writing learning objectives is a good opportunity to begin thinking about this lesson scope, and can provide assistance when you are faced with a difficult decision about what content to cut out.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the order in which new skills must be acquired. Before learners can begin to acquire âhigher-levelâ cognitive skills to perform creative and analytical tasks, they must first acquire the foundational knowledge and conceptual understanding of the domain. Furthermore, these higher-level skills take longer to acquire so, unless you can expect your target audience to arrive at the lesson with the relevant foundational knowledge and understanding, it is probably unrealistic to aim to have learners completing creative tasks before its end.</p>
<p>As should become clear through activities in the upcoming episodes, lessons can be broadly considered as blocks of content associated with a particular learning objective. This can be helpful when making choices about content to remove, because the task can be considered in the context of taking out whole learning objectives.</p>

<p>The source of all The Carpentries lessons is made publicly-available in repositories on <a href="https://github.com/" class="external-link">GitHub</a>. By making our repositories public like this, we encourage others to help us maintain and improve our lessons, and make it as easy as possible for them to re-use and modify our lessons for their own purposes.</p>
<p>GitHub provides a hosting service to open source projects such as these, allowing users to present their projects to the wider world. The repository includes a complete history of the changes made between versions of the individual files in the project, and provides many features that facilitate collaboration on projects. We will learn more about some of those collaborative features later in this training. For now, we will focus on one other important feature that GitHub provides: website hosting.</p>
<p>Via a system called <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>, users can build and host websites from the files present in any repository on GitHub. For many years, this has been how The Carpentries presents its lesson websites to the world.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">A Brief History of The Carpentries Lesson Infrastructure</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>In the past, our lesson sites were generated by software called <em><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="external-link">Jekyll</a></em>, a tool built into GitHub Pages that allows the webpage content, written in the text files of the repository, to be combined with descriptions of settings, structure, and styling, to create a website. The template used by Jekyll to structure and style lessons was initially developed in 2013/2014 by Abby Cabunoc Mayes, Greg Wilson, Jon Pipitone, and Michael Hansen for <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/" class="external-link">Software Carpentry</a>. It was <a href="https://github.com/carpentries/styles/graphs/contributors" class="external-link">expanded and maintained by many members of the community</a> over almost a decade, to also support <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/" class="external-link">Data Carpentry</a>, <a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/" class="external-link">Library Carpentry</a>, and many other lessons.</p>
<p>In 2022, we adopted a new infrastructure for our lesson sites: <strong>The Carpentries Workbench</strong>. Lesson sites built on the Workbench are still hosted with GitHub Pages, but no longer use Jekyll. Instead, the lessons are built using <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" class="external-link">a programming language, <em>R</em></a>, and <em><a href="https://pandoc.org/" class="external-link">pandoc</a></em>, a software designed for converting content between file formats. The Workbench combines three R packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper/" class="external-link">sandpaper</a>: converts a collection of Markdown or RMarkdown files into the structure of a lesson website.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/" class="external-link">varnish</a>: provides the files and folders that add styling and additional functionality to a lesson website.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/pegboard" class="external-link">pegboard</a>: an programmatic interface to the lesson, enabling various automated validation tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>For lesson developers, the Workbench makes The Carpentries lesson repositories much simpler to navigate and work with.</p>

<p>To get started, we first need to create a new repository for our lesson. We will use a template to do this, so that the new repository contains the basic files and folders that the Workbench needs in order to build a lesson site. There are currently two templates to choose between:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://github.com/carpentries/workbench-template-md/generate" class="external-link">A Markdown template</a></li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/carpentries/workbench-template-rmd/generate" class="external-link">An RMarkdown template</a>, best suited to lessons that will include R source code that will generate output.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>One member of each participating lesson team</strong> should choose one of these templates, following the link above and completing the configuration as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>add a name for the repository
<ul>
<li>The name should be descriptive but fairly brief, with hyphens (<code>-</code>) to separate words</li>
<li>the name can always be changed later, via the repository settings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in the âDescriptionâ field, write the title of your lesson</li>
<li>choose âPublicâ visibility</li>
<li>make sure the âInclude all branchesâ box is checked</li>

<ul>
<li>Click <em>Add people</em> and enter the GitHub username of one of our collaborators.</li>
<li>Click <em>Add USERNAME to this repository</em>.</li>

For the rest of this training, you should add and edit files on <code>main</code>, and in future, when you open Pull Requests to update the lesson content, these should also be made to <code>main</code>. The <code>gh-pages</code> branch should never be modified by anyone other than the automated actions-user account.</p>

<p>After following these steps, when you navigate to the pages URL, you should be see a lesson website with The Carpentries logo and âLesson Titleâ in the top-left corner. You may need to wait a few minutes for the website to be generated.</p>

<p>The lesson title can be adjusted by modifying the <code>config.yaml</code> file in the repository. The <code>config.yaml</code> file contains several global parameters for a lesson - to determine some of the page styling, contact details for the lesson, etc - and is written in <em><a href="https://yaml.org/" class="external-link">YAML</a></em>, a structured file format of key-pair values. As well as the title of the lesson, you can and should adjust some of the other values in <code>config.yaml</code>, but you should not need to add new values or learn a lot about YAML to be able to configure your lesson.</p>

<p>The <code>episodes</code> folder of the new repository contains a single file, <code>01-introduction.md</code>. The content of this file includes examples of how to write Markdown files for The Carpentries Workbench.</p>
<p>There are two important things to note:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Like <code>index.md</code>, the episode file begins with a short header. The fields in this header describe the episode title and the estimated time (in minutes) required to teach it and complete the exercises.</li>
<li>The example content includes several lines that start with strings of colons (<code>:::::::</code>). These mark the beginnings and ends of structural elements within the page, called <em>fenced divs</em>. Each fenced div starts and ends with a string of colons. A word at the end of the starting colons indicates what kind of block it is. We will explore them in more detail later in the training.</li>
</ol>
<p>Letâs create a new episode file, for one of the episodes you have just identified. First, open the ârawâ view of the <code>01-introduction.md</code> example episode, and copy the first 19 lines, down to the blank line under the closing string of the <code>objectives</code> div.</p>

<p>In <em>Defining Lesson Objectives</em>, you created a list of the learning objectives for your lesson as a whole. This process is helpful as a way to set the end goal and, coupled with the expected prior knowledge of the target audience you identified, describe the scope of the lesson.</p>
<p>We can use the same approach for the individual episodes of a lesson, defining objectives for the episode to make clear what we intend to teach in that section. Defining these objectives <em>before writing the episode content</em> helps us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>stay focused in the episode, without spending time on non-essential topics</li>
<li>determine whether learners are attaining the skills we wish to teach them (we will discuss this more in the next two episodes)</li>

<p>As we have seen previously, defining objectives for a lesson (or a teaching episode) can help to focus your content on the most important learning outcomes and outline the scope of your lesson project. With learning objectives you have defined your <strong>intended (or planned) curriculum</strong> - what you set out to accomplish with your lesson. The skills and knowledge your learners actually leave with and can demonstrate after the workshop having followed the <strong>implemented curriculum</strong> in the classroom is called the <strong>attained curriculum</strong>. <strong>Implemented curriculum</strong> includes the concepts, relationships and skills that are explicitly covered in your lesson and translated into classroom practices - i.e.Â the teaching and learning activities that should lead to your learners attaining knowledge.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Hidden Curriculum</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>There is one more curriculum at play here - <strong>hidden curriculum</strong> includes all unintended curricular effects that influence learning but are not explicitly addressed in the lesson content - e.g.Â (unofficial) social and cultural norms, behaviours and values that are transferred by instructors to learners, often unconsciously. These are all the additional things that people learn about the topic from <em>the way</em> your lesson is taught, rather than from its official content. You can use Instructor Notes (covered in more detail in <a href="20-preparing.html">âPreparing to Teachâ</a> episode) to guide instructors on some of the aspects of the hidden curriculum, e.g.Â to encourage them to follow certain tried and tested practices.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The goal of the remaining steps of lesson development is to ensure that the attained curriculum matches the intended curriculum as closely as possible. To do so, you need to develop assessments to ensure progression towards your learning outcomes.</p>

<section id="assessments"><h2 class="section-heading">Assessments</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In order to measure progress and evaluate if and what learning occurred - we use various types of assessments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>summative assessments</strong> - used to verify whether learners achieved the stated learning objectives after instruction.</li>
<li>
<strong>formative assessments</strong> - used to detect changes in learner performance <em>during</em> instruction, to provide feedback and insight into the learnersâ developing mental models of the topic taught and to identify any old or developing misconceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summative assessments</strong> sum up what learning has been achieved after training (e.g.Â via exams). They give valuable data about learning attainment by individuals and entire cohorts but are not used to guide further progress. They may not be as suitable for short courses, but may be necessary for those that give marks/grades or certificates of completion.</p>
<p><strong>Formative assessments</strong> are applied throughout a course and with several different purposes: they provide a way to move <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/05-memory/index.html#using-formative-assessment-to-support-memory-consolidation" class="external-link">new information from working memory to long-term memory</a>; they can inform instructorsâ decisions about how to modify instruction to better promote learning; they also inform learners about changes they may need to make to improve their learning. Ideally, they should be used often (e.g.Â after every 15-20 minutes of teaching), providing opportunities to instructors to change pace and refocus learnersâ attention. For short courses, formative assessments are usually more valuable and easier to implement in practice than summative assessments - they need not be complex or time-consuming, just informative enough about learning for both instructors and learners.</p>
<p>The most effective way to test learner understanding is to do such assessments in class - they engage all learners and allow instructors to check learnersâ confidence with the content and its delivery, can help you deal with any potential misunderstandings as soon as they arise, and maximise the value of workshop for everyone. Such formative assessments also help with <em>metacognition</em> - the awareness a learner has that they are succeeding in learning something new.</p>
<p>Any instructional tool that generates feedback and is used in a formative way to check for learnersâ understanding can be described as âformative assessmentâ. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>reflection</strong> at the end of a session to help process learning - e.g.Â asking learners to write down things they learned, things they want to know more about and any questions they still have</li>
<li>
<strong>concept maps and diagrams</strong> - asking learners to reflect by drawing/labeling a concept map/diagram or writing down a list of new concepts and skills theyâve learned and (optionally) how they relate to one another or connect with previous knowledge</li>
<li>
<strong>minute cards</strong> - gauging learnersâ satisfaction and understanding using agreed signals (e.g.Â raising different coloured post-it/sticky notes to indicate that the pace is too fast/slow, that they completed/have not completed an exercise).</li>
</ul>
<p>Many other formative assessment tools can be found in Briggsâ list of <a href="https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/features/21-ways-to-check-for-student-understanding/" class="external-link">â21 ways to check for student understandingâ</a> or Edutopiaâs <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/groups/assessment/250941" class="external-link">â56 Examples of Formative Assessmentâ</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercises</strong> are one important type of formative assessment. We will now have a look into exercises that perform misconception checks and ask students diagnostic questions; we will cover a few other types of exercises that help with retaining new knowledge in one of the later episodes.</p>
</section><section id="detecting-misconceptions"><h2 class="section-heading">Detecting Misconceptions</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Detecting and correcting <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning/#misconceptions" class="external-link">misconceptions</a> and fixing learnersâ incorrect/broken <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning/#building-a-mental-model" class="external-link">mental models</a> is as important as presenting your learners with new knowledge and correct information. <em>Why is it important to identify misconceptions as early as possible?</em> When mental models are broken, learning can occur slower than you might expect. The longer a prior incorrect model is in use, and the more extensively it has to be âunlearnedâ, the more it can actively interfere with the incorporation of the new correct knowledge (since it will contradict the misconceptions already present in the mental model).</p>

<div id="exercise-misconceptions-5-minutes" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Exercise: misconceptions (5 minutes)</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>What are the common misconceptions learners can have about the topic of your lesson? How might you identify that misconception in your learners while they follow your lesson? Share your answer in the collaborative notes document.</p>
<p>Hint: Try thinking about related or common tools the learners might know and how applying that prior knowledge might lead to a misconception with the topic you are teaching.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p><a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning/#using-formative-assessment-to-identify-misconceptions" class="external-link">Multiple choice question (MCQ)</a> exercises are types of a formative assessment that can help you target anticipated misconceptions. When designed carefully, each incorrect answer in a MCQ will have diagnostic power and provide valuable insight into how a mental model is broken. For example, suppose we are teaching children multi-digit addition. An example of a well-designed MCQ (<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning/#using-formative-assessment-to-identify-misconceptions" class="external-link">borrowed from The Carpentries Instructor Training</a>) in this case could be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is 27 + 15?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>42</li>
<li>32</li>
<li>312</li>
<li>33</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The correct answer is 42, but each of the other answers provides a valuable insight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>they do not understand the concept of a carry and are throwing it away completely</li>
<li>they understand the concept of a carry and know that they cannot just discard the carried â1â, but do not understand that it is actually a ten and needs to be added into the next column - they are treating each column of numbers as unconnected to its neighbours.</li>
<li>they understand that they need to carry â1â but are adding it to the wrong column.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Their diagnostic power means that each of the wrong choices helps an instructor figure out precisely what misconceptions learners had adopted and in which ways their mental models are broken. As a result the instructor may decide to review a particular concept or change the pace of instruction. At the same time, learners get feedback about what they have misunderstood and what they need to focus their study efforts on - we call this <strong>guided practice</strong>.</p>
<p>When designing a lesson, for diagnostic assessments you can think about problems or questions from previous training events and what people struggled with, or think about your own misconceptions in the past or ask colleagues about their experiences. You should aim to create all your assessments before you have written the explanatory content of your lesson (recall Nichollâs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_design" class="external-link">backward design</a>). These assessments will guide your lesson design process by knowing exactly which knowledge youâd expect from your learners at any point in the lesson.</p>

<section id="exercise-your-memory"><h2 class="section-heading">Exercise Your Memory</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In a simplified model of memory individuals are equipped with two types of memory:<br>
working (also called short-term) and long-term. Long-term memory essentially has unlimited storage but is slow to access, whereas working memory is quicker to access but can only hold a limited number of items at a time. For teaching, the goal is to help learners move the new things theyâve learned from working memory into long-term memory. One of the ways lesson developers can aid in this process is through exercises. In addition to providing formative assessments for instructors and check for misconceptions and broken mental models, exercises help move new skills and concepts into long-term memory by providing learners an opportunity to practice what was recently learned. Exercises should occur frequently throughout the lesson because they move items to long-term memory and free up learnersâ working memory for new items.</p>
<p>Creating exercises builds upon the learning objectives you created earlier in the lesson design process. You can design exercises based on the actions/skills you described in your learning objectives (the learning outcomes you intend for the lesson). This will be easier if your wrote learning objectives with specific action verbs. Specific verbs can help you decide what action you want the learners to perform in the exercise. E.g. actions such as âexplainâ and âdescribeâ may be better assessed by discussions and multiple choice questions, while âsolve,â âconstruct,â âtestâ and other higher-level cognitive skills may be better assessed by debugging tasks, <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#code-run" class="external-link">code-and-run</a>, or use-in-a-different-context exercises.</p>

<p>The Trainers will assign you to pairs or small groups, and give each group an exercise type to focus on. Each group should assign a notetaker, to summarise your discussion at the end of the exercise.</p>

</ul>
<p>Then, discuss the following questions together:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of skills would an exercise of this type assess? Try to identify some action verbs like those we used to write lesson objectives earlier in the workshop.</li>
<li>Would this type of exercise be suited to a novice audience? Or is it a better fit for intermediate or advanced learners?</li>
<li>Would this kind of exercise work well in an in-person workshop setting? Would it be better suited to self-directed learning and/or a virtual workshop?</li>
</ul>
<p>Share the major points of your discussion in the collaborative notes document.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As you discussed with your group in the last exercise, different types of learning objectives work better for novices, while others are a better fit for competent practitioners or experts.</p>
<p>This can be understood in terms of the types of exercises that suit the objective: exercise types that help manage cognitive load for the learner, such as <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#faded-examples" class="external-link">faded examples</a> and <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#parsons-problem" class="external-link">Parsons problems</a> (which both provide a lot of the guiding process/scaffolding code and allow the learner to focus on a specific concept or skill) are a good fit for a novice, to whom all elements of the topic are new. However, these kinds of exercise do not provide an opportunity for learners to develop higher-level skills, such as the ability to create whole new functions or scripts, or to extrapolate from the examples they have seen to solve a different kind of problem. Indeed, example and exercise types that are helpful to novices <a href="https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/blob/gh-pages/files/papers/kirschner-minimal-guidance-fails-2006.pdf" class="external-link">may even be counter-productive for learners with a greater level of expertise</a>.</p>
<p>Thus you want to choose your objectives to fit your intended audience and your exercise formats to fit your objectives.</p>

<p><em>âDifferent types of lesson objectives (LOs) are better fit for novices, while others are better fit for competent practitioners, etc. and if exercises (formative assessments) are well aligned to LOs, [they] will automatically serve the corresponding audience. Thinking in terms of LOs (What should a learner do in order to achieve this specific LO? Is this LO exactly what learners are expected to achieve by the end of this piece of instruction? etc.) is easier than thinking in terms of LOs + audience + content. LOs should be tailored to the audience, and, if this is well done, you may stop worrying about the audience. Create LOs for the specific audience and create assessments for specific LOs.â</em></p>

<p>Well-designed exercises are one of the most valuable resources for an instructor and any time spent on this is well invested.</p>
<p>To create an exercise in The Carpentries Workbench, you can use colon-delimited sections called âfenced divsâ. In fact <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/instructor/component-guide.html#callout-blocks" class="external-link">there are many types of boxes in the lesson infrastucture that use fenced divs</a>. In the Workbench, exercises are divided into two categories: <em>discussions</em> (where the main task is for participants to discuss a topic or prompt) and <em>challenges</em> (where the main task is a problem to be solved).</p>
<p>To start a challenge fenced div the line must contain at least 3 colons, then the <code>challenge</code> tag. Then the content of the challenge is included on the following lines. Finally, you can close the fenced div using another line with least 3 colons.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Using the approach demonstrated above, format the MCQ you designed previously as an exercise in your lesson site.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some other types of formative assessment include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Think, pair, share</strong> - learners <em>think</em> about an answer to a question, <em>pair</em> up with a classmate to discuss their answer, and then <em>share</em> out the consensus they came to with the class.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sticky/post-it notes and written feedback</strong> - learners each get two colors of sticky notes. If they fall behind or run into an issue, they can put up the color that signals they need help. If they have completed and exercise or think the instructor could speed up, they put their other sticky note up. Then at breaks these stickies can turn into written feedback <strong>minute cards</strong>, where the learner writes down one thing they were confused about or that could be improved and one thing that went well or they really liked learning.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reflective assessment</strong> - learners spend time reflecting on what they have learned so far. Reflection aids in transferring newly learned concepts into long-term memory and can be really helpful for <em>metacognition</em>, where learners think about the process of learning, becoming aware of their progress towards acquiring new skills. Developing metacognition improves learnersâ ability to guide their own learning on a topic after they have finished the lesson. Reflection exercises can include using what was taught to label a diagram, draw a concept map, free write, or fill in a guided worksheet.</li>

<section id="creating-a-narrative"><h2 class="section-heading">Creating a narrative</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<!--- Should this section go before LO and questions? --><p>Writing your lesson as a story helps learners stay motivated and engaged. The story you create can also help learners more easily connect how the skills they are learning now could be useful after the workshop. You can enable learners to make connections between what they learn in your lesson and their own work by creating a narrative that resembles a situation the learners might encounter there. Depending on the tool you are teaching, you might also include a particular dataset as a part of the story you are weaving into your lesson. It is common for lessons to include a dataset that is used in examples and discussed throughout. This can help you maintain a narrative flow and make the lesson feel more authentic. Even if your topic doesnât require a dataset, deciding on a consistent narrative will help create a flow between lessons and reduce cognitive load for learners.</p>
</section><section id="finding-a-dataset"><h2 class="section-heading">Finding a dataset</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>When searching for a dataset to use in your lesson, there are a number of factors to consider. First, if possible you want the dataset to be an authentic use case for researchers in your target audience. This means balancing the size and complexity of a dataset while avoiding additional cognative load for learners. The dataset may need a certain number of observations to demonstrate some of the skills you are teaching or have a number of variables that is sufficiently similar to what learners may encounter in their work to feel authentic. At the same time, you want your learners to be able to interpret the data fairly easily during the lesson so they can focus on the skills you are teaching. This may mean you will need to subset your dataset or remove variables observed.</p>
<p>You may also want to include and review a data dictionary in your lesson, explicitly taking the time to review the information included in the dataset. For inspiration, see the <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/socialsci-workshop/data/" class="external-link">Social Sciences Data Carpentry data dictionary</a>. An additional factor to consider when choosing a dataset to include is the license. You want to find a dataset where the data provider allows for you to freely use it. The best option is a dataset with a CC0 (Public Domain Dedication) license, as other licenses may have more ambiguity around data reuse. Lessons included in <a href="https://carpentries-incubator.org/" class="external-link">The Carpentries Incubator</a> are encouraged to use CC0 licensed data, and may be required to do so to qualify for peer review in <a href="https://carpentries-lab.org/" class="external-link">The Carpentries Lab</a>. Even with a CC0 license, you will still want to follow best practice in giving attribution to the data provider or collecting agency.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>An example dataset used in the Data Carpentry Ecology lessons is the <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459" class="external-link">Portal Project Teaching Database</a>. This dataset is an actual ecological research project that was simplified for teaching. The reuse of this dataset throughout the Data Carpentry Ecology lessons helps stitch together the process of data analysis on throughout the workshop, from data entry and cleaning to analysis and visualization.</p>
<p>When deciding on a dataset, it is also important to consider the ethical use of each dataset considered. <em>Does the data contain personally identifiable information?</em> <em>Was the data collected without permission from the groups or individuals included?</em> <em>Will the data be upsetting to learners in the workshop?</em> If the answer to any of these questions might be yes, you will need to do more research on it and continue to look for other options. Commonly data is misused from historically excluded and exploited groups. The <a href="https://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-043" class="external-link">CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance</a> (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) are good starting point for thinking about data sovereignty and considering the ethics of data collected about an individual or groups of people.</p>

<p>Referring to the advice given above, find an appropriate dataset or a narrative for your lesson. Identify one or more potential candidates and note down the advantages and disadvantages of each one.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Learners are motivated if you <strong>teach most useful things first</strong>. As you think about what story your lesson will tell, it is important to put the pieces that are most interesting to learners up front. If they are able to quickly learn tools or skills that they see as useful from your lesson, they will be more interested in continuing to learn other concepts that are needed. You may notice this trend in many of the Software Carpentry lessons. In particular, many of the coding language lessons (R and Python) have the learners create a plot very early in the lesson and then go back and teach coding fundamentals such as loops and conditionals. Visualization of data is often a very motivating and much needed skill by learners. Getting to visualization early, keeps learners interested in learning the additional and vital skills where the application might be less clear.</p>

<p>Remember, even if you do not need a dataset for your lesson, you should decide on a narrative. Centering your lesson around a central example reduces the cognitive load of switching between examples throughout the lesson. Using an authentic, yet simple, dataset will also help reduce cognitive load and help learners to see how they might apply what they learned to their own projects. It is also important to consider licensing and ethical considerations when looking for a lesson dataset.</p>

<section id="writing-explanatory-text"><h2 class="section-heading">Writing Explanatory Text</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Explanatory text helps connect your examples and exercises together into a cohesive lesson. If your examples and exercises are train stations and scenic views, the explanatory text is the train tracks that connect them. Often times the examples and exercises may seem like a good draft for you to teach. However, the explanatory text makes it possible for other instructors and self-directed learners to follow along by providing all the relevant information directly in the lesson. It can also help you remember your goals and stay on track teaching.</p>
<p>How much text to include is often a question of personal style while balancing the needs of potential users, both other instructors and learners. You want to find the balance between providing enough information for learners to meet the learning objectives without increasing cognitive load with extraneous information. In this section we will discuss factors to consider when you are writing explanatory text.</p>
<p>There are trade-offs to consider when preparing a site for use as an instructional guide vs use as a self-directed learning resource. Typically, self-directed learning resources are more verbose where instructional guides are aimed at an audience that can fill in the gaps on their own. However, very sparse text is less likely to be re-usable by other instructors as instructors may have different skill levels with the lesson content or differing mental models. In general, it is not a good idea to assume others, learners or instructors, will know what you were thinking when you wrote the content so, if in doubt, be explicit.</p>

<div id="using-callouts" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Using Callouts</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Often lessons have more content than can be reasonably taught in the amount of time allotted. This is especially true for collaboratively developed lessons as each contributor/instructor may have additional items theyâd like to see included, leading to âscope creepâ.</p>
<p>To address this issue, in many Carpentries lessons, callout boxes are used for asides and short tangents, e.g.Â points that might be relevant to some audiences but are not essential to the flow of the lesson. These callouts should still be kept to a minimum as they can be disruptive to instructors and readers.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</section><section id="less-is-more"><h2 class="section-heading">Less is More</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Trying to fit too much content into a lesson is counter-productive. It is better to cover less and provide a smaller but stable foundation for learners to build upon.</p>
<p>You should also consider a realistic workshop length for teaching your lesson. It is difficult to keep learners attentive for many hours over many days. Most Carpentries workshops are two work days of lesson material as it is difficult for learners to attend 4 full days of a workshop. Although, there are some in the community who will run workshops that are three days to cover additional material.</p>
<p>As you consider the length of your lesson discuss with your collaborators and ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is essential to include?</li>
<li>What can be left out if needed?</li>
<li>Are there checkpoints where the lesson could end if needed?</li>
<li>Can important concepts be moved up earlier to ensure they are covered?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, the only way to know for sure is to teach the lesson, measuring how long it takes to teach. Borrowing from television, the Carpentries community calls these early workshops, pilot workshops. As you run pilot workshops, you can note the length of time spent in each episode. You might find the <a href="https://codimd.carpentries.org/lesson-pilot-observation-notes-template#" class="external-link">template for notes on pilot workshops</a> helpful as it includes a table for episode and exercise timings. Instructors commonly report running short on time in workshops. Thus, it is better to assume that you are under-estimating rather than over-estimating the length. It is better to have additional time for discussion, review, and wrap-up than to rush through material to fit it into the remaining time.</p>
<p>If, after piloting your new lesson, you find that you did not have time to cover all the content, approach cutting down the lesson by identifying which learning objectives to remove. Then take out the objective(s) and the corresponding assessment(s) and explanatory content. You may consider making a <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning/#mapping-a-mental-model" class="external-link">concept map</a> to help identify which objectives depend on one another.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you decide to keep certain objectives in the lesson, you can add suggestions on which objectives can be skipped to the Instructor Notes for the lesson.</p>

<p>The third option, âLine graph of increasing carbon dioxide in ppm at the Mauna Loa Observatory from 1958 to presentâ, is the best option. It describes the type of plot, what is measured, and the trend.</p>
<p>The first two options are too vague. They mention a graph but donât give enough info to know what the graph is actually showing.</p>
<p>The last option is overly descriptive and starts to list the data itself. It is better to include a shorter, but informative, description and a link to the data instead.</p>

<p>When writing a lesson, you should also consider adding key terms to the lesson glossary for the lesson. Following the instructions on <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/editing.html#learners" class="external-link">how to create a glossary in the Workbench documentation</a> will help you to create this section of the lesson.</p>
<p>Many of these terms may also be useful for other lessons and can be added to <a href="https://glosario.carpentries.org/" class="external-link">Glosario</a>, a multilingual glossary for computing and data science terms.</p>

The questions box helps learners understand what to expect from a lesson as they might not yet understand the learning objectives. The keypoints box wraps up the lesson by providing answers to each of the questions. Keypoints also help self-directed learners review what they learned, remind instructors to recap what was covered in an episode, and help you ensure you answered all the questions you intended for an episode.</p>

<p>Until now, this training has focused on the internals of a lesson development project. Now it is time to consider the context in which this lesson development can take place.</p>
<section id="the-carpentries-lesson-development-ecosystem"><h2 class="section-heading">The Carpentries Lesson Development Ecosystem</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p><a href="https://carpentries-incubator.org/" class="external-link">The Carpentries Incubator</a> is a space for The Carpentries community to collaborate on lessons. It provides a single location where our community can come to find lessons that are being developed by the community, and to create new lessons using The Carpentries Workbench. Community members retain ownership of their lessons hosted in the Incubator, while benefiting from the increased findability it gives to the lesson.</p>
<p>The Carpentries supports the lesson developer community working in the Incubator with training (like this one), communications designed to raise awareness of lesson projects within the community, and platforms for the community to discuss and collaborate on lesson development.</p>
<p>The Carpentries also provides a space for community-developed lessons to reside after the initial phases of development have been completed. <a href="https://carpentries-lab.org/" class="external-link">The Carpentries Lab</a> provides a platform for open peer-review of lessons, and hosts the collection of lessons that have passed through this review process. These peer-reviewed lessons can be considered ready to teach by any Instructor with sufficient knowledge of the topic. In the future, this lesson review process may also be used to determine when a lesson in the Incubator is ready to be incorporated into one of The Carpentries <em>Lesson Programs</em>, the collection of lessons and curricula that can be taught in an official workshop for Software, Library, or Data Carpentry.</p>
</section><section id="the-lesson-life-cycle"><h2 class="section-heading">The Lesson Life Cycle</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>To make it easier for other community members to assess the current state of a lesson in the Incubator, The Carpentries encourages lesson developers to indicate the status of their lesson by labelling its progress through a <em>lesson life cycle</em>:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/life_cycle.png" alt="Diagram of the life cycle of a lesson in The Carpentries ecosystem. A lesson is proposed at the beginning of the  pre-alpha stage. It enters alpha when it is taught for the first time. In beta, it is  taught by other instructors. A full release of the lesson is made when it is stable.  Pilot workshops take place during the alpha and beta phases. The Carpentries Lab hosts  open peer review of lessons that have completed the beta phase." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>The life cycle of a lesson</figcaption></figure><p>Each life cycle stage indicates the level of maturity of a lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>pre-alpha</strong>: a first draft of the lesson is still being constructed.</li>
<li>
<strong>alpha</strong>: the lesson has been/is being taught by the original authors, but has not been fully tested.</li>
<li>
<strong>beta</strong>: the lesson is ready to be taught by instructors who have not been significantly involved in its developed to this point.</li>
<li>
<strong>stable</strong>: the lesson has been extensively tested by the authors and others. It can be considered broadly complete and unlikely to undergo any drastic changes without warning.</li>
</ul>
<p>The life cycle stage of a lesson is displayed as a banner on the lesson site, as a label on the lesson GitHub repository, and alongside the lesson whenever it is shown on The Carpentries websites and lesson listings.</p>
<p>The life cycle stage for a lesson is configured in the <code>config.yaml</code> file we encountered when we were first introduced to <a href="07-infrastructure.html">The Carpentries Workbench</a>, as a value for the <code>life_cycle</code> field. For new lesson repositories, this value is already set to âpre-alphaâ, so you should not have to change it yet.</p>

<div id="the-carpentry-field" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">The <code>carpentry</code> Field</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>The <code>config.yaml</code> file also contains a <code>carpentry</code> field, which can be used to adjust the styling applied to a lesson website e.g.Â to make it look like a lesson from the Software, Library, or Data Carpentry Lesson Programs.</p>
<p>For community-developed lessons, where no official relationship exists with one of these Lesson Programs, you should keep using the <code>incubator</code> setting, before potentially switching over to another styling when the lesson moves e.g.Â into The Carpentries Lab.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</section><section id="pilot-workshops"><h2 class="section-heading">Pilot Workshops</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In line with <a href="03-audience.html">the importance we placed on evaluation of lesson content earlier in this training</a>, the life cycle described above places considerable emphasis on the testing of lessons in <strong>pilot workshops</strong>.</p>
<p>For these pilot workshops to provide an effective evaluation of the lesson, it is essential to seize the opportunity they provide to collect feedback and data. For example, a pilot workshop offers a chance to answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much time does it take to teach each section of the lesson?</li>
<li>How much time is required for each exercise?</li>
<li>What technical issues were encountered during the lesson?</li>
<li>What questions did learners ask during the workshop?</li>
<li>Which parts of the lesson were confusing for learners?</li>
<li>Which exercises could be improved to provide more information to the instructors?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://codimd.carpentries.org/lesson-pilot-observation-notes-template#" class="external-link">The pilot workshop notes template</a> provides a starting point, but it takes a lot of time and effort to keep track of all this information during a pilot workshop. It can be helpful to assign this task to a member of the lesson development team, who can dedicate themselves to observing the pilot and taking notes. As soon as the pilot has finished, it is a good idea to take some time to share the notes with the other lesson authors, to reflect on and discuss the experience of teaching the lesson, and to synthesise the lesson notes and any action items that come from this debrief into specific action items to improve the lesson. These should be added as new issues on the lesson repository, to help you keep track of the work that needs doing for the next iteration.</p>
<p>For beta pilot workshops, where the lesson is taught by instructors who have not yet made a major contribution to its development, it is vital that instructors have the opportunity before the workshop to learn about the lesson from the authors, and to debrief with the authors afterwards so that they can share their experience and observations about how the lesson could be further improved.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>With over 100 lessons under development in The Carpentries Incubator, the lesson developer community is thriving. Connecting with this community can be a great way to find collaborators to contribute to or test your lesson, to stay up to date with the latest support provided to the community, and to learn from the experience of others.</p>
<p>Here are a community activities and channels that you might be interested in joining:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>lesson-dev</code> channel on <a href="https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/" class="external-link">The Carpentries Slack workspace</a>. This is a platform for the community to ask questions and make announcements about lesson development. You could also browse the other channels on the workspace for any that are relevant to the topic of your lesson.
<ul>
<li>You may also find it helpful to create a new channel on Slack for discussion of your lesson. Chat channels like this can be valuable ways for a remote team to communicate and collaborate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/incubator-developers" class="external-link">The <code>incubator-developers</code> list on TopicBox</a>. The Carpentries Curriculum Team uses this mailing list to make relevant announcements to the community of lesson developers working in Incubator.</li>
<li>The Carpentries Curriculum Team hosts monthly Lesson Development Coworking Sessions, which are a good opportunity to engage with other lesson developers and make regular progress on your project.

<p>By now you should have developed objectives, exercises/formative assessments, and examples for at least one of the episodes in your lesson. In order to prepare to teach it (for the first time in particular) youâll need to create a teaching plan and design a method to collect feedback on your lesson.</p>
<section id="teaching-plan"><h2 class="section-heading">Teaching Plan</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>A teaching plan outlines the structure of your teaching session, including details, estimated duration and materials needed to deliver it. For example, a teaching plan may contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>welcome, introductions and motivation for the lesson - to introduce yourself, aims and objectives of the lesson and how it will help learners</li>
<li>setup - to check if everyone is ready to proceed with the lesson</li>
<li>segments of teaching and exercises from the lesson and any other planned activities (e.g.Â group discussions, wrap-up and feedback)</li>

<p><em>âI usually create detailed notes organised in a concept map/workflow in order to make everything consistent. I also write next to each bit of teaching the time approximately needed. For each lesson I create (and reuse when I teach again the same lesson) very detailed notes of what happens during the lesson, including teaching goals and learning objectives I mean to achieve with each bit of lesson. This rich lesson plan requires a lot of work the first time I teach a lesson, but reduces a lot the preparation time of future lessons and are super useful to other teachers.â</em></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Figures and other visual aids are great tools to help participants understand the content being presented and make associations between pieces of information. If you are planning on using these in your teaching session/pilot - remember to enhance them with the <a href="https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81" class="external-link">alternative text (alt)</a> describing the figure for individuals using screen readers or by placing explanatory text adjacent to relevant parts of visualisation.</p>
<p>If your lesson requires participants to use any software, tools or data - it is worthwhile investing time now into creating clear download, installation and setup instructions for participants to follow and circulating them ahead of the workshop. This will give you more time at the pilot for teaching the lesson as troubleshooting setup problems on the spot can be time-consuming and stressful. Each Carpentries lesson has a dedicated place for setup instructions within The Carpentries Workbench located in the file <code>learners/setup.md</code> off the lesson project root.</p>

<p>Another standard piece of The Carpentries Workbench are the <em>Instructor Notes</em> pages - intended to help you and other instructors deliver your lesson by providing useful tips for how to best run a workshop or explain âstickyâ points in the lesson. Instructor Notes for your lesson are located in the <code>instructors/instructor-notes.md</code> file off your lesson project root where you may consider adding the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>rationale, strengths and/or weaknesses of the lesson design</li>
<li>what has been tried before and what worked/did not work</li>
<li>tips for teaching the lesson/particular episodes</li>
<li>challenges encountered</li>
<li>troubleshooting common setup/installation/exercise issues</li>
<li>parts that seem to cause trouble or most confusion for learners (i.e.Â where to tread carefully, spend more time explaining)</li>
</ul>
<p>It may initially be difficult to create Instructor Notes until you have taught the lesson yourself for the first time - but after the first pilot you will have enough feedback to draft them.</p>

</section><section id="feedback-collection-plan"><h2 class="section-heading">Feedback Collection Plan</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There is a lot to collect feedback on when trialling a new lesson and this is arguably the most important part of your teaching plan. It can be hard to capture all this information yourself while you are teaching, hence you will need help from your team - make sure you assign the feedback collection roles ahead of your pilot. Additionally, when you are advertising your workshop, try and make it clear to the participants you are piloting a new lesson and that they will be actively helping you refine it as well as learning new things themselves. This can help focus their attention on the feedback you need to collect from them, which you should be doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>constantly and throughout the workshop</strong> - refer to the <a href="19-operations.html#pilot-workshops">âPilot Workshopsâ episode</a> for suggestions on things to track and the <a href="https://codimd.carpentries.org/lesson-pilot-observation-notes-template#" class="external-link">pilot workshop notes template</a> and other suggested feedback collection mechanisms to help you gather such information. To recap, you should be noting down the amount of time used to teach each episode, amount of time used for each exercise, technical issues encountered during the lesson, bugs and unexpected behaviour, missing solutions, questions and suggestions from participants, sources of confusion, interesting discussions, etc. These may occur at any point at the workshop, either verbally or in the chat function of the video conferencing tool (for online workshops) - plan to have someone try to capture as much as possible.</li>

You may design a special form that participants can fill in anonymously - here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OGCQBotD2nOJkc7KpFZLhFfb3EBcxEDwHz_3p48qz3U/template/preview" class="external-link">post-workshop survey template</a> for workshops that pilot a lesson in The Carpentries Incubator. You can use it as a starting point for a post-workshop survey to be shared with your learners at the end of the pilot workshop and you can supplement it with additional questions.</li>

<p>The final part of this training will focus on the skills needed to collaborate effectively. Before that there will be a break, during which we would like you to complete the following three tasks:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Teach one episode of your lesson (probably the one you have been working on in these two days) See the <a href="trial-runs.html">Lesson Trial Runs</a> page for full details.</li>
<li>After your trial run has concluded (immediately after, or when you have reviewed any feedback you collected from learners), note down your answers to the following questions:
<ul>
<li>What worked?</li>
<li>What did not?</li>
<li>What will you do differently next time?</li>
<li>What will you change in your material you taught? We will refer to these notes when we reconvene for the last episode of this training.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Based on your experience teaching the material and the feedback you received from your learners and helpers, make a list of issues you have identified with the material you prepared, e.g.:
<ul>
<li>examples that did not work as expected,</li>
<li>improvements that could be made to exercises,</li>
<li>parts that learners found particularly challenging,</li>
<li>unexpected questions or misconceptions that came up during the trial run.</li>

<p>Recent sections of this training have focused on how to design effective assessments and write a lesson that will be engaging and motivating for learners. We provided further opportunities to apply these concepts to the development of a lesson website with The Carpentries Workbench. Next, we explored The Carpentries lesson development ecosystem and how a new lesson project can fit into that. We finished up with a discussion of the importance of teaching a new lesson and how best to prepare for that experience.</p>
<p>The final sessions will focus on collaboration skills, exploring how trainees can curate their repository and manage their project to foster collaboration and build community around a lesson.</p>
<p>Before that, there will be an extended break during which trainees should conduct a <em>trial run</em> of the lesson content they have been developing in the workshop so far. When the training recommences, there will be an opportunity for trainees to share their experiences and reflections from those trial runs, and to discuss what impact that will have on the next stages of their lesson development.</p>
<p>Please provide another round of feedback and spend some time reflecting.</p>

<p>Welcome back! In this section of the training, we will learn more about the skills and tools you can use to become an effective collaborator on an open source lesson.

<p>In the break since last time, you should have trialled some of the lesson you set out to develop in this training. Congratulations on organising and delivering your first pilot! We will use this session to reflect on that experience, and take some steps to ensure that the feedback and notes you gathered during the trial run are used to improve the quality of your lesson.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Discussion: trial runs (35 minutes)</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Look back at the notes you took and feedback you received during your trial run (5 mins).</p>
<p>Now report out to the other participants about that trial run. Try to answer some or all of the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What worked well both in terms of content and delivery?</li>
<li>What did not work as well?</li>
<li>How close were your time estimates to the actual time needed to teach the material and finish exercises?</li>
<li>How did the audience perceive the difficulty level of the material?</li>
<li>What will you do differently next time?</li>
<li>What will you change in the material you taught?</li>
<li>What will you change in the way you collect feedback in future pilots?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Moving forward from your first pilot, the next steps to consider are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record all the identified changes and improvements that can be made to the lesson material and assigning a person from the team responsible for each task. The above exercise provided some reflection points after a trial run; in terms of lesson content they may translate into the following considerations:
<ul>
<li>is the material too dense, does it need extra explanations?</li>
<li>would adding a diagram help explain or curate things better?</li>
<li>is there too much content for one episode and do you need to split into smaller teaching units?</li>
<li>do you need to re-organise and move some content around to improve the flow and narrative?</li>
<li>are there enough exercises and practical work?</li>
<li>do you need to realign your lesson objectives and key messages?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decide if some of the feedback you will not action. Remember, you do not need to respond to every piece of feedback you receive. For example, it is easy to fall down the rabbit hole of adding extra material just because someone suggested it may be a useful thing - sometimes adding a link or a callout to extra reading is sufficient. You need to be able to draw a line under any extra modification suggestions to keep you in scope and on schedule.</li>
<li>Schedule follow-up co-working sessions with your team to carry on working on fixing issues and adding new content to maintain the momentum.</li>
<li>Add/Update you lessonsâ Instructor Notes based on what you learned and to help other instructors teach your lesson.</li>
<li>Think about the timeline for your next pilot(s), even provisionally, to help you set milestones and targets to work towards.</li>
<li>Consider writing up your pilot experience in a mini blog post that you can share with the community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Designing and developing quality lessons is hard - there are many pieces of a puzzle that have to come into place: both pedagogical and organisational. Do not be disheartened with the amount and type of feedback you may have received. Even Carpentries lessons that have been around for 10+ years receive improvement suggestions and fixes almost on a daily basis. From our experience, bigger lessons that are delivered over a few days require several full pilots before they can even be considered for a <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development/the-lesson-life-cycle.html" class="external-link">beta</a> release. Planning smaller lesson trials (where you test only a portion of a lesson) and doing them more often with a friendly audience from your local groups and close colleagues is more manageable and will help you make steady progress.</p>

<p>So far, the focus of the training was on lesson development skills. In this section, we will learn more about the skills and tools you can use to become an effective collaborator on an open source lesson development project and how to employ your lesson development skills in a team environment. Collaboration skills covered here are transferrable to any similar open source project you may be involved with.</p>
<p>You may start working on projects by yourself or with a small group of collaborators you already know, but open source projects in the Carpentries community often grow beyond that small group. Community collaboration is the cornerstone of The Carpentries - all curricula and various programmes are developed together by the community members across borders, domains and backgrounds. Most initiatives are done through community consultation and collaboration is used as a pathway to empower people, give members a sense of purpose in the community and realise shared goals.</p>
<p>Collaboration helps bring different perspectives to solving a problem and share the load of the required work to develop, pilot, and, later on, maintain the lesson. People drop in and out of projects for various reasons and their levels of involvement may vary over time due to other commitments - for this reason it is worth taking time from the outset to make a project welcoming for newcomers in order to achieve a steady number of people working on your project at any time. You should plan to make it easy for new collaborators to join, to set up a local workspace so that they can contribute, help them find tasks so that they know what to contribute, and make the contribution process clear so that they know how to contribute. You also want to make it easy to give people credit for their work on your project as well as for others to reuse and give credit to your project. From this episode on, we cover best practices for collaboration and tools available to us achieve it.</p>
<section id="documenting-your-lesson"><h2 class="section-heading">Documenting your lesson</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>For collaborative projects, it is important to spend the time on âexternal-facingâ features, such as documentation, to make the project as welcoming and as easy to get involved in as possible for newcomers who may not have a deep grasp of the project or know all its existing problems. Such documentation will be useful to yourself and other team members at well, e.g.Â if you are trying to come back to the project after a break or are reusing it for a new collaboration in the future.</p>
<p>Your lesson documentation should contain the following information, which should be kept up to date.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="description-of-the-project---readme-file">Description of the project - <code>README</code> file<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#description-of-the-project---readme-file"></a>
</h3>
<p><code>README</code>, <code>README.txt</code> or <code>README.md</code> is a plain text or Markdown file located in the projectâs root directory representing the default landing or home page for repositories in GitHub (and similar project repositories) by convention. It represents the first piece of documentation that people will see when visiting your lesson repository, hence it should concisely explain what the lesson is about and who it is for, and contain links and pointers to further information. For example, <code>README</code> should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>lesson title</strong></li>
<li><strong>lesson description</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>rendered version of the lesson</strong> - even though this is typically included in the <code>About</code> section of the repository, it is always useful to link to the URL where the rendered lesson is available</li>
<li>
<strong>contact information</strong> - include up-to-date email addresses or mailing lists or other details on how to get in touch with the lesson maintainers</li>
<li>
<strong>contributing information</strong> - this is an opportunity to list what kinds of contribution are sought and how to get involved in lesson development for new contributors. You can provide more details in a separate <code>CONTRIBUTING</code> file within the repositoryâs root directory and link to it from <code>README</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>credits/acknowledgements</strong> - make sure to credit those who have helped in the lessonâs development or inspired it, and/or any resources/templates that you have reused. You can also link to a separate <code>AUTHORS.md</code> file within the repositoryâs root directory to list all the people who contributed to the lesson content (if this list starts to become too large to include in the <code>README</code> itself)</li>
<li>
<strong>citation</strong> - a convention is to include the citation information for your lesson in a separate <code>CITATION</code> file within the repositoryâs root directory (and link to it from <code>README</code>) so others can cite the use of the lesson in their own publications and media and it can also be automatically discovered by other applications. Citation can be a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) issued by a reputable DOI-issuing repository such as <a href="https://zenodo.org/" class="external-link">Zenodo</a>, which should be obtained as a permanent identifier as soon as your lesson reaches the beta stage, or an appropriate academic publication once your lesson becomes stable and is peer-reviewed. Citation can be contained in a plain text file (<code>CITATION</code>, <code>CITATION.txt</code>), a Markdown file (<code>CITATION.md</code>), or in the recently adopted <a href="https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format" class="external-link">Citation File Format</a> (<code>CITATION.cff</code>). The CFF is defined using <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/" class="external-link">YAML</a> (which we already encountered in the <code>config.yaml</code> file for the lesson website) and is now <a href="https://github.blog/2021-08-19-enhanced-support-citations-github/" class="external-link">the recommended way of storing citations in GitHub</a>. Advantages of using CFF are that GitHub will automatically show the citation information in the sidebar, making it more visible and accessible for visitors to your repository. In addition, metadata from <code>CITATION.cff</code> files will automatically be used by <a href="https://zenodo.org/" class="external-link">Zenodo</a> when registering the DOI for your lesson/project. CFF metadata is also recognised by the <a href="https://www.zotero.org/" class="external-link">Zotero reference manager</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>license</strong> - a short description of and a link to the lessonâs license typically contained in a separate <code>LICENSE</code>, <code>LICENSE.txt</code> or <code>LICENSE.md</code> file within the repositoryâs root directory. The lesson repository created from the Carpentries lesson template already contains a default <code>LICENSE.md</code> file, but you should modify this to more accurately describe how the lesson content can be re-used by others.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="instructions-for-contributors---contributing-file">Instructions for contributors - <code>CONTRIBUTING</code> file<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#instructions-for-contributors---contributing-file"></a>
</h3>
<p><code>CONTRIBUTING</code>, <code>CONTRIBUTING.txt</code> or <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> is a text or Markdown file within the repositoryâs root directory where you should provide detailed description of the ways people can send their contributions, what kinds of contribution will be credited and in what ways. For example, at what point would someone be listed as an author and how you will credit contributions that are not recorded in the commit history of the project. The latter is particularly important for newcomers who may not be proficient with the use of GitHubâs features for collaborative work, such as issues, mentions, pull requests and code review, but could still provide valuable input and contributions.</p>
<p>Carpentries lesson repositories already have a generic Carpentries <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file to get you started. You should review it and, if need be, modify it to fit your teamâs needs and way of working. For example, you may want to expand on what contributions you are <em>not</em> looking for if your lesson already contains more material than can be covered in a typical workshop. You can also detail all channels on which you are willing to receive contributions on if they are different from the defaults included in the file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="issue-and-pull-request-templates">Issue and pull request templates<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#issue-and-pull-request-templates"></a>
</h3>
<p>Consider setting up <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository" class="external-link">issue and pull request templates</a>) to help newcomers who may not have much experience working on collaborative projects in GitHub. Such templates can provide a structure for the issue/pull request description, and/or prompt them to fill in answers to pre-set questions. Both can help contributors raise issues or submit pull requests in a way that is clear, helpful and provides enough information for maintainers to act upon (without going back and forth to extract it). GitHub provides a range of default templates, but you can also <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository" class="external-link">write your own</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="other-documentation">Other documentation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#other-documentation"></a>

<p>Once you have set up the basic documentation about your lesson, you may consider adding the following useful information to your documentation too:</p>
<ul>
<li>set-up guides for installing and rendering the lesson locally. In most cases, a link to <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/" class="external-link">The Carpentries Workbench documentation</a> will be sufficient.</li>

<p>In addition to having the complete documentation in the lesson repository, The Carpentries community provides a number of ways to further raise the visibility of the lesson among the broader community and encourage community members to contribute to its further development. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>listing issues from the lesson repository on <a href="https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/" class="external-link">The Carpentries Help Wanted page</a>
</li>
<li>featuring your lesson in <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/spotlight.html" class="external-link">the Incubator Lesson Spotlight</a>
</li>
<li>writing a blog post about the lesson for <a href="https://carpentries.org/blog" class="external-link">The Carpentries Blog</a>, and/or attending a community discussion call to promote the lesson</li>
<li>advertising the lesson at various Carpentries mailing lists - e.g.Â <a href="https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss" class="external-link">general discussion</a>, <a href="https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/instructors" class="external-link">instructors</a>, regional communities or specific curriculum lists</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider including your lesson in <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/" class="external-link">Hacktoberfest</a> and similar wider community open source events aimed at encouraging people to contribute to open source projects periodically throughout the year.</p>

<h3 id="issue-labelling-for-newcomers">Issue labelling for newcomers<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#issue-labelling-for-newcomers"></a>
</h3>
<p>You can encourage contributions to your lesson from newcomers by using specific labels on issues to highlight suitable opportunities to help. Apply the <code>good first issue</code> or <code>help wanted</code> labels to issues in your repository to indicate that the maintainers will particularly welcome help or pull requests fixing such issues.</p>

<p>GitHub implements a comprehensive <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications" class="external-link">notifications system</a> to keep you up-to-date with activities in the lesson repository. GitHub also provides an additional useful notification feature for collaborative work - <strong>Mentions</strong>. The mention system notifies team members when somebody else references them in an issue, comment or pull request - you can use this to notify people when you want to check a detail with them, or let them know something has been fixed or changed (much easier than writing out all the same information again in an email!). You can use the mention system to link to individual GitHub accounts or whole teams for mentioning multiple people. Typing <code>@</code> in GitHub will bring up a list of all accounts and teams linked to the repository that can be âmentionedâ.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository" class="external-link">GitHubâs documentation on setting notifications on individual repository</a>. You can choose whether to watch or unwatch an individual repository, or can choose to only be notified of certain event types such as issues, pull requests, mentions, etc.</p>

<p>In this episode we expand on how to use GitHub effectively among a group of known collaborators, building on top of tools and practices we introduced for working with newcomers. Everything you do to help your lesson be more attractive and informative to newcomers will benefit all collaborators. Here, we explore GitHub features to help you keep track of what needs doing on the lesson, making decisions and managing your project.</p>
<section id="managing-issues"><h2 class="section-heading">Managing issues</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p><strong>Issues</strong> are GitHubâs framework for managing issue/bug reports, feature requests, and lists of future work. They provide a single shared record of all the problems people have found with the lesson, and improvements that could be made, along with solutions and discussions around them. This helps the team to keep track of what they need to work on later, and reduces the chance of receiving redundant reports of issues you already know about.</p>
<p>When you create an issue, you can add a range of details to it. An issue can be assigned to a specific team member - this can be a helpful way to know who is currently working to fix an issue or a way to assign responsibility to someone to deal with it. You can assign one or more labels to issues to classify or group them. Labels can also be given colours, allowing you to see at a glance from the Issues page the state of your project. The default labels available in GitHub include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>bug</code> - indicates an unexpected problem or unintended behavior</li>
<li>
<code>documentation</code> - indicates a need for improvements or additions to documentation</li>
<li>
<code>duplicate</code> - indicates similar or already reported issues, pull requests, or discussions</li>
<li>
<code>enhancement</code> - indicates new feature requests, or if they are created by a lesson maintainer, indicate planned new features</li>
<li>
<code>good first issue</code> - indicates a good issue for first-time contributors</li>
<li>
<code>help wanted</code> - indicates that a maintainer wants help on an issue or pull request</li>
<li>
<code>invalid</code> - indicates that an issue, pull request, or discussion is no longer relevant</li>
<li>
<code>question</code> - indicates that an issue, pull request, or discussion needs more information</li>
<li>
<code>wontfix</code> - indicates that work wonât continue on an issue, pull request, or discussion</li>
</ul>
<p>Check the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels" class="external-link">GitHub documentaiton on Issues</a> for the full reference. We have already seen some of these labels - recall the <code>help wanted</code> and <code>good first issue</code> labels aimed at newcomers to your project discussed in the previous episode. You can also create your own custom labels to help with classifying issues. There are no rules really about naming the labels - use whatever makes sense for your project. Some conventional custom labels include: <code>status:in progress</code> (to indicate that someone started working on the issue), <code>status:blocked</code> (to indicate that the progress on addressing issue is blocked by another issue or activity), etc.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Exercises: creating issues (15 minutes)</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>After your trial run, you should have created a list of issues you identified with your lesson. Open issues on the GitHub repository for your lesson, for each item on that list. Remember to add labels to each issue according to its type, priority, etc. As you create them, you may also want to assign these issues to a member of your lesson development team.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</section><section id="managing-communication"><h2 class="section-heading">Managing communication</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Having an open, publicly-visible list of all the issues with your project is a helpful way of letting people know you are aware of issues and you are working on them. This can indicate to an external audience that the project is active. It also provides you and your collaborators with an âat a glanceâ view of the state of the project, making it easier to prioritise future work.</p>
<p>As we have seen in the previous episode, GitHubâs notifications framework <strong>Mentions</strong> plays an important part in communicating between collaborators and is used as a way of alerting team members of activities and referencing one issue/comment/pull requests from another.</p>
<p><a href="https://slack.com/" class="external-link">Slack</a> is commonly used in the Carpentries community for quick, day-to-day message exchange among teams. You can create your own <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/" class="external-link">Slack workspace for free</a> or create a channel for your lesson development project under <a href="https://swcarpentry.slack.com/" class="external-link">the Carpentries public Slack workspace</a>. Note that the Carpentries Slack is an enterprise workspace so all messages and files will be retained and no messages will be lost (for free workspaces only the most recent 10,000 messages can be viewed and searched and file storage limit is 5 GB).</p>
<p>Collaborators can also use other platforms to discuss lesson development or receive contributions from newcomers who are not yet fluent in using GitHubâs systems of communication. The Carpentries can assist with creating a mailing list specific to the development of your lesson on their <a href="https://carpentries.topicbox.com/" class="external-link">TopicBox</a> platform for managing threaded email discussions. Also make sure to join the <a href="https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/incubator-developers" class="external-link">Incubator lesson developers mailing list</a> on TopicBox to keep an eye on announcements and discussions relating to lesson development in general within the Carpentries community.</p>
<p>Meeting minutes are a useful way of providing a permanent record of the purpose of a meeting and what was talked about, including any decisions made or actions taken, that can be referred back to for any follow-ups. Recording meeting minutes does not have to be hard - remember that you are part of a team and there are many platforms that allow collaborative note taking. The Carpentries provides <a href="https://codimd.carpentries.org/" class="external-link">CodiMD</a> and <a href="https://pad.carpentries.org/" class="external-link">Etherpad</a> instances as two options for taking shared notes, widely used at workshops for sharing pieces of code, references and notes between instructors and learners. For some advice on holding effective meetings, see <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:meetings" class="external-link">the <em>Meetings, meetings, meetings</em> section of Teaching Tech Together</a> by Greg Wilson.</p>
</section><section id="project-management"><h2 class="section-heading">Project management</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Developing a lesson is a project and, like most projects, it consists of multiple tasks. Keeping track of the list of tasks the team has to do, progress on each, prioritising tasks for future development, sprints and releases, etc., quickly becomes a non-trivial task in itself. Without a good project management framework, it can be hard to keep track of whatâs done, or what needs doing, and particularly difficult to convey that to others in the team or share the responsibilities.</p>
<p>GitHubâs project management framework <strong>Project Board</strong> is a tool for keeping track of all the different components of a project, and what their current status is. It does this using columns and cards - you break your project down into tasks which you write on cards, then move the cards between columns that describe the status of each task. Cards are usually small, descriptive and self-contained tasks that build on each other. Breaking a project down into clearly-defined tasks makes it a lot easier to manage and develop. GitHub project boards interact and integrate with the other features of the site such as issues and pull requests - cards can be added to track the progress of such tasks and automatically moved between columns based on their progress or status.</p>
<p>GitHub provides template boards that by default contain the three âbasicâ columns, with pretty self-explanatory names:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>To Do</code></li>
<li><code>In Progress</code></li>
<li><code>Done</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If you add an issue or pull request to a card in the board, it will automatically be moved to âDoneâ for you when you close the issue or merge the pull request. One common extra column is <code>On hold</code> or <code>Waiting</code>. If you have tasks that get held up by waiting on other people (e.g.Â to respond to your questions) then moving them to a separate column makes their current state clearer.</p>
<p>You can also create a card without an issue. Such cards (or notes) can have detailed content like checklists. GitHub also allows you to convert a card to an issue so you can add labels or detailed comments to it. Sometimes, a card you thought was simple and self-contained might turn out to be a bigger task than you anticipated - in that case, it is sensible to create new cards that reference the one they broke off from.</p>
<p>Once your project board has a large number of cards on it, you might want to begin priorisiting them. Not all tasks are going to be equally important, and some will require others to be completed before they can even be begun. Common methods of prioritisation include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Vertical position</strong>: the vertical arrangement of cards in a column implicitly represents their importance. High-priority bugs go to the top of <code>To Do</code>, whilst tasks that depend on others go beneath them. This is the easiest one to implement, though you have to remember to correctly place cards when you add them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Priority columns</strong>: instead of a single <code>To Do</code> column, you can have two or more, for example - <code>To Do: Low Priority</code> and <code>To Do: High Priority</code>. When adding a card, you pick which is the appropriate column for it. You can even add a Triage column for newly-added issues that youâve not yet had time to classify. This format works well for project boards devoted to bugs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Labels</strong>: if you convert each card into an issue, then you can label them with their priority - remember GitHub lets you create custom labels and set their colours. Label colours can provide a very visually clear indication of issue priority but require more administrative work on the project, as each card has to be an issue to be assigned a label. If you choose this route for issue prioritisation - be aware of accessibility issues for colour-blind people when picking colours.</li>
</ul></section><section id="project-governance"><h2 class="section-heading">Project governance</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In addition to managing your project on a day-to-day basis, you should consider a governance model for your lesson to describe the ground rules of participation, the roles that project participants can take on and the process for decision making within the project. You may wonder why youâd ever need a formal governance process - after all, everyone in your team is collegial, polite and hard-working. However, even among the most harmonious teams you will likely realise you need an agreed way to make decisions and resolve conflicts when your team encounters their first real disagreement.</p>
<p>The moment your collaborator group exceeds 3 or 4 members (and fewer if the collaborators do not all know each other equally well at the outset) you should establish and document some kind of governance process. It will help mitigate any power imbalances which are expressed when one team member (or a group of team members) are more vocal and are able to dominate the decision-making process. It is advised to make these considerations early on, before your project grows too much and introducing structure and process into it becomes more difficult and complicated. Besides, if you do not establish these processes from the start, you are likely to discover the need to do so only when you first encounter disagreement within the team: a situation unlikely to provide perfect conditions for a discussion of governance.</p>
<p>Here are some aspects of governing a project that you should consider. These are borrowed from <a href="https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/teams.html" class="external-link">the <em>Working in teams</em> chapter</a> of <a href="https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/index.html" class="external-link"><em>Research Software Engineering with Python</em></a>, a book on how to work productively in small teams where everyone is welcome:</p>

</ul>
<p>For some other examples and inspirations of governance processes, consider the following:</p>

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/github/MVG" class="external-link">GitHubâs Minimum Viable Governance</a> (MVG) for establishing a lightweight governance process into free and open source projects that are run in version control systems. In MVG decisions are made through consensus of the project maintainers or determined based on the maintainersâ consideration of a number of factors in âgood faithâ" (when explicit agreement of all maintainers cannot be reached). In reality, consensus-based governance can run you into trouble when you hit an issue where maintainers do not all agree but still want to make progress. Also, the definition of âgood faithâ is open to interpretation and leaves plenty of room for people, especially the powerful, to get away with acting in bad faith. A system based on voting and majorities may help you get around this issue. MVG is designed for a one organisation-many projects setup and is too elaborate for a single lesson project. However, it includes âboilerplateâ template files for a steering committee, charter, governance, Code of Conduct documents, and language laying out a preference for consensus but with voting as a fallback, and other templates that may be helpful for those starting out and unsure about how to get on with establishing a governance process.</li>
