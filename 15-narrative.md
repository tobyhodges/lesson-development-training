## Creating a narrative

<!--- Should this section go before LO and questions? -->

Writing your lesson as a story helps learners stay motivated and engaged.
The story you create can also help learners more easily connect how the skills they
are learning now could be useful after the workshop.
You can enable learners to make connections between what they learn in your lesson and their
own work by creating a narrative that resembles a situation the learners might
encounter there.
Depending on the tool you are teaching, you might also include a particular dataset as a part of the story you are weaving into your lesson.
It is common for lessons to include a dataset that is used in examples and discussed throughout.
This can help you maintain a narrative flow and make the lesson feel more authentic.
Even if your topic doesn't require a dataset, deciding on a consistent narrative will
help create a flow between lessons and reduce cognitive load for learners.


## Finding a dataset

When searching for a dataset to use in your lesson, 
there are a number of factors to consider.
First, if possible you want the dataset to be an authentic use
case for researchers in your target audience.
This means balancing the size and complexity of a dataset
while avoiding additional cognative load for learners.
The dataset may need a certain number of observations
to demonstrate some of the skills you are teaching or have a
number of variables that is sufficiently similar to what learners may encounter
in their work to feel authentic.
At the same time, you want your learners to be able to interpret the
data fairly easily during the lesson so they can focus on the skills
you are teaching.
This may mean you will need to subset your dataset or remove variables
observed.

You may also want to include and review a data dictionary in your lesson,
explicitly taking the time to review the information included in the
dataset.
For inspiration, see the [Social Sciences Data Carpentry data dictionary](https://datacarpentry.org/socialsci-workshop/data/).
An additional factor to consider when choosing a dataset to include is 
the license.
You want to find a dataset where the data provider allows for you to freely use it.
The best option is a dataset with a CC0 (Public Domain Dedication) license, as
other licenses may have more ambiguity around data reuse.
Lessons included in [The Carpentries Incubator][carpentries-incubator] are encouraged to use CC0 licensed data, and may be required to do so to qualify for peer review in [The Carpentries Lab][carpentries-lab].
Even with a CC0 license, you will still want to follow best practice in 
giving attribution to the data provider or collecting agency.

## More CC0 License Reading

If you'd like to read more about CC0 and CC-BY, Katie Fortney wrote an excellent 
[blogpost on why CC-BY is not always a good fit](https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2016/09/cc-by-and-data-not-always-a-good-fit/).

::::::::::::::::::


An example dataset used in the Data Carpentry Ecology lessons is the [Portal
Project Teaching Database](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459).  This dataset is an actual ecological research project that was simplified for teaching.
The reuse of this dataset throughout the Data Carpentry Ecology lessons helps
stitch together the process of data analysis on throughout the workshop, from
data entry and cleaning to analysis and visualization.

When deciding on a dataset, it is also important to consider the ethical use of
each dataset considered.  *Does the data contain personally identifiable information?*
*Was the data collected without permission from the groups or individuals included?*
*Will the data be upsetting to learners in the workshop?*
If the answer to any of these questions might be yes, you will need to do more
research on it and continue to look for other options.  Commonly data is misused
from historically excluded and exploited groups.
The [CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance](https://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-043) (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) are good starting point
for thinking about data sovereignty and considering the ethics of data collected
about an individual or groups of people.


### Examples of Public Repositories

When looking for data to reuse, consider public repositories in the subject area
for your lesson or general data repositories such as:

  - [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/)
  - [The Data Cuartion Network's datasets](https://datacurationnetwork.org/datasets/)
  - [The Offical Portal for European Data](https://data.europa.eu/)
  - [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/)
- [The Official Portal for Argentina Data](https://www.datos.gob.ar/) - (In Spanish)

## Exercise: Choosing a Dataset or Narrative (30 minutes)

Referring to the advice given above, find an appropriate dataset or a narrative for your lesson.
Identify one or more potential candidates and note down the advantages and disadvantages of each one.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Learners are motivated if you **teach most useful things first**.
As you think about what story your lesson will tell, it is important to put
the pieces that are most interesting to learners up front.
If they are able to quickly learn tools or skills that they see as useful from your 
lesson, they will be more interested in continuing to learn other concepts that are 
needed.
You may notice this trend in many of the Software Carpentry lessons.  In particular,
many of the coding language lessons (R and Python) have the learners create a plot
very early in the lesson and then go back and teach coding fundamentals such as loops
and conditionals. Visualization of data is often a very motivating and much needed
skill by learners. Getting to visualization early, keeps learners interested in 
learning the additional and vital skills where the application might be less clear.

## Exercise: Examples Before Exercises (20 minutes)

Looking back at one of the exercises you designed before:
what examples could you include in your narrative to teach learners the skills
they will need to apply to complete the formative assessments you have designed?

Outline one of these examples in your episode file.

## Summary

Remember, even if you do not need a dataset for your lesson, you should 
decide on a narrative.
Centering your lesson around a central example reduces the cognitive load of 
switching between examples throughout the lesson.
Using an authentic, yet simple, dataset will also help reduce cognitive
load and help learners to see how they might apply what they learned to their own
projects.
It is also important to consider licensing and ethical considerations when looking 
for a lesson dataset.


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Using a narrative throughout a lesson helps reduce learner cognitive load
- Choosing a lesson includes considering data license and ethical considerations.
- Openly-licensed datasets can be found in subject area repositories or general data repositories.
